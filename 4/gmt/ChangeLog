2014-03-01	pwessel
	* GMT 4.5.12 finalized and released [GSHHG 2.3.0 was released on Feb 1]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2014-02-17	fwobbe
	* gmt_init.c etc.:	File locking -- if enabled via -DFLOCK -- is
				non-compulsory now.  This means if fcntl fails for some reason,
				GMT continues to access the file.  Hence, it is recommended to
				configure GMT with --enable-flock even if fcntl might be buggy
				on some ancient NFS shares.

2014-02-17	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		Size for memory allocation cast the product of nx * ny to
				size_t but overflow had already happen as calculation was
				done using ints, then cast to size_t. Must cast nx and ny
				separately.
2014-02-10	jluis
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	Make sure the default style IDs are unique for each process.

2014-02-07	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		Make sure that images in KML files do not carry a directory name

2014-02-03	pwessel
	* pslib.c:		Auto-widen paragraph width to at least fit widest word.

2014-02-01	pwessel
	* configure.ac:		Since GSHHG 2.3.0 was released today, make that the default

2014-01-26	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Building the grid command string could exceed its length if
				the argument became exactly the max length of the array; then
				a final extra character \0 would be added and exceed array length.
				Thanks to Joachim Saul for pointing it out.

2014-01-22	pwessel
	* pscoast.c:		The processing of -I -N levels and pens could get out of sync
				so that the wrong pen was used for the specified feature.

	* pslib.c:		Take superscripts and subscripts into account when determining
				dimensions of text box.

2014-01-10	pwessel
	* grdmath.c:		Had to let SDIST return km instead of degrees since it cannot
				do degrees for geodesics.  By doing km it is now aligned with
				what PDIST and LDIST returns for geographic data, and matches
				what GMT5 does.  Some scripts had to be modified to handle the
				new behavior.  If you use SDIST you may wish to check your usage.
				Also fixed bug in SDIST in that spherical selected geodesics
				and ellipsoidal selected great circles (we want the opposite).
				To assist users wanting spherical degrees we have added the
				two conversion operators KM2DEG and DEG2KM.

2014-01-09	pwessel
	* gmt_vector.c:		Add protection against introduced longitude-jumps produced
				by resampling in GMT_fix_up_path.

				could get stuck in infinite loop.

2013-12-22	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		Grid crosses clipped by map boundary was messed up (Issue 461)

2013-12-10	pwessel
	* grdvector.c:		Vector direction did not adjust when negative scales were
				used in -JX or -Jx.
	* psxy[z].c		---"---

	* ps2raster.c:		Better reporting if any of the system calls to gs or gdal_translate
				fail.

2013-11-08	pwessel
	* ps2raster.c:		Under Mavericks, strcpy would exit if the to and from pointers
				are the same, so need to check.
	* grdvector.c:		The new -I check had some issues that caused recalculation of
				the given increments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2013-11-05	pwessel
	* GMT 4.5.10 finalized and released, with GSHHG 2.2.4, and with GMT 5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2013-11-03	pwessel
	* gmtlogo, gmtget, gmt_shell_scripts.sh:
				These all needed to be prepared by configure via *.in files
				to set the correct GMT4 bindir, otherwise the GMT script would
				pick other versions.

2013-10-31	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77list.c:	Picked id = time_column when set was 1 (custom), causing the
				first custom data column to be formatted as time.

	* grdmath.c:		Fix bug in CURV operator.

2013-10-05	pwessel

2013-09-14	pwessel
	* psmask.c:		Multiple, ancient bugs fixed: properly mark used edges, fix
				memory allocations, not report clipping if -D is used, starting
				point for a contour was not offset by 1/2 pixel.

2013-09-02	pwessel
	* psmask.c:		Was off by one in grd index, thus exceeding array length at end.

2013-08-24	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		The GMT_import_table function checked for greenwich before assigning
				the input data (issue #357).

				in contrast, -S or -Sp skips all points outside domain before
				triangularization.
	* meca/psvelo.c:	Called get_trans at NP but could not handle the truth.

2013-05-17	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		GMT_grdproject_init did not handle increments that had been
				specified as units, e.g., -D30e.

2013-05-09	pwessel
	* share/x2sys:		Added dat.def for mgd77 ASCII DAT format.

2013-04-19
	* grdmath.c:		The XOR operator was incorrect, it is now clarified to be
				0 if A == NaN and B == NaN, NaN if B == NaN, else A.
	* grdlandmask.c:	Did not set output as geographic after using -Jx1d.

2013-04-18	pwessel

				with azimuthal projections.

2013-04-03	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		When -Jx is used with longitudes we must use the wesn-clipping
				and outside functions, not the Cartesian ones.
				Fixed clipping problem in wesn_clip for regions > 180 but < 360.

2013-03-25	pwessel
	* greenspline.c:	The normalization for 2-D with geographic data suffered from

2012-06-11	pwessel
	* spotter/originator.c:	Bad format statement would wreck the 5th output column when
				run in default mode.

2012-05-31	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		With -R...r and -JE, pscoast could end up trying to paint a
				block that is outside the rectangular region yet whose projection
				completely contains the region.
2012-05-11	pwessel
	* gmtmath.c:		Operators UPPER and LOWER did not assign output to rows
				that contain NaN.
	* misc/dimfilter.c:	Initialized a max value to -DBL_MIN instead of -DBL_MAX.

2012-04-29	pwessel
	* src/gshhg:		Renamed supplement and tools to gshhg to match how

2012-04-18	pwessel
	* spotter/backtracker.c:	First and last point in a path was not converted back
				from geocentric coordinates.

2012-04-15	pwessel

	* gmt_plot.c:		Eliminated notch in corners of rectangular map frames (same as for linear frames)

2012-03-17	pwessel
	* minmax.c:		Avoid infinite loop if a record has different number of fields than expected.

2012-03-13	remko
	* configure.ac:		Added support of GNU/kFreeBSD OS.

2012-03-09	pwessel
	* mgd77/*.c:		Introduced support for NGDC's MGD77T (tab-delimited) format
	* mgd77list.c:		Confused the meaning of -F shorthands mgd77 and all.  Now handle
				all the stored and derived quantities needed to reproduce original data.

2012-02-27	pwessel
	* *.c. */*.c:		Some failed to use FIELD_DELIMITER and/or D_FORMAT for ascii output.

2012-02-24	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_inonout_sphpol_count did not properly handle line segments
				that were exactly vertical in all cases, leading to errors as
				to a point being inside or outside a spherical polygon.

2012-02-14	remko
	* GNUmakefile, configure.ac:	Split off triangle code again into gmt-${version}-non-gpl.tar.bz2

2012-02-13	pwessel
	* gmt_proj.c:		Determine if N or S polar for conic projections by looking at the
				selected region, not the central point [D. Scheirer report 2/9/2012].

2012-02-07	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		On Windows the ghostscript executable path is now fetch from
				the registry. In case it fails, fall back to the old "get
				it from the path" mechanism.
	* gmt_math.h:		Revert the s_rint change. It was causing lots of troubles to
	* pslib.c:		compile with VS.

2012-02-02	pwessel
	* gmt_proj.c:		For -JE, both projection center and antipode gave x = y = 0.
				Now, antipode results in NaN, NaN.

2012-01-13	jluis
	* s_rint.c:		(for) Windows rint function that does ieee compliant rounding like GCC
	* gmt_math.h:
	* pslib.c:

	* gmt_support.c:	Fixed error in reading colors of pattern in -G option

2012-01-10	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		-R0/360 and -JMlon/lat would not set global_map properly,
				giving NaNs as scale.

2012-01-08	pwessel
	* grdcut.c:		The -Z would give incorrect -R for pixel grids.  Now also
				print warning if output grid equals input grid (no change).

2012-01-06	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		In GMT_xy_axis, string[GMT_CALSTRING_LENGTH] was used to hold
				labels that could be longer, leading to memory corruption.
	* gmt_support.c:	In GMT_hold_contour_sub, a variable called closed (which could
				a flag 0-3) was used as a 0/1 variable.  Added is_closed = 0|1.

2012-01-05	jluis
	* gmt_customio.c:	Make nx and ny of 'unsigned short int' type in surfer6 header.
				Note that original format specification by Golden Software
				clearly say they are 'short int' but this change shouldn't
				break anything and will allow dealing with larger grid sizes.

2011-12-03	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77track.c:	Did not set GMT's time system to Unix before dealing
				with dates.  Now done centrally by MGD77_Init.

2011-12-02	pwessel
	* project.c:		For -G<inc> -bo we failed to write any output.

2011-11-30	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_getfill got confused when a Windows path C:\etc was
				given as an pattern file (mixed up with :F and :B mechanism).

2011-11-21	pwessel
	* grdview.c:		Also, when nodes are adjusted by small to avoid matching a
				contour value exactly (during contouring), the same adjustment
				must be made later when those nodes are used to determine how
				to stitch together polygons for fill.

2011-11-21	jluis
	* pscoupe|polar|velo.c	Could not read from stdin because of the cross dll boundaries
				on Win, must use GMT_stdin instead of stdin.

2011-11-19	jluis
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Fix memory allocation bug in MGD77_Read_Header_Sequence() where
				it was reading MGD77_RECORD_LENGTH records into a shorter
				MGD77_HEADER_LENGTH longer variable.

2011-11-18	pwessel
	* grdview.c:		The contouring could suffer from the same round-off issues that
				affected grdcontour (and fixed back in 2004).  Now same fix is
				applied in grdview.  Also set -S to 0 as stated in man page;
				this matches default in grdcontour as well.

2011-11-17	pwessel
	* grdlandmask.c:	Now recognizes a -R for global grid when nx*dx == 360.
	* nearneighbor.c:	--"--
	* grdcut.c:		--"--
	* grdfilter.c:		--"--
	* grdinfo.c:		--"--
	* grdimage.c:		--"--

	* gmt_plot.c:		Fixed the corner caps in linear base frames.

2011-11-13	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		The opening of files for rec-by-rec grid read had a mix if-test
				that could take us to the else clause inadvertently.

2011-10-25	remko
	* gmt_notposix.c:	Introduced as in GMT5. Moving stuff from gmt_stat.c.
	* gmt_math.h:		Be more careful declaring function as 'extern' only when
				there is no macro.

2011-10-23	jluis
	* gmt_notunix.h:	Use #undef HAVE_<func>, instead of #define HAVE_<func> 0
				(prev change in gmt_notposix broke compiling on Windows)
	* gmt_math.h:		Do not declare existing functions as 'extern' that cause a
				flooding of 'inconsistent dll linkage' warnings on Windows.

2011-10-18	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_cross.c:	Memset call used wrong size if 64-bit, thus not resetting
				some boolean values causing crossovers to be missed.

2011-10-14	pwessel
	* test/meca:		Added new meca_5.sh test from Vala Hjorleifsdottir

2011-10-11	remko

	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_crossover was susceptible to longitude wrapping.

2011-10-01	remko
	* xyz2grd.c:		Only request 2 columns when using -An.

2011-09-28	jluis
	* xyz2grd.c:		On Windows it never actually opened the input xyz file,
				so a crash resulted down the road.

2011-09-20	pwessel
	* meca:			psvelo{.c,txt} did not show -A in synopsis.

2011-08-24	remko

	* pslib.c:		Use SVN revision number in ps_bulkcopy

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2011-07-27      pwessel
	Now under subversion control under repository name gmt4.  To check out a copy:
		svn checkout svn://gmtserver.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt4 or, for a "trunkless" copy:
		svn checkout svn://gmtserver.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt4/trunk gmt4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2011-07-21	pwessel
	* project.c:		The 4/28/2011 fix traded one bug for another.  Now works
				both with and without -G.  New test/fitcircle/circles.sh
				exercise both options.

2011-07-18	pwessel
	* pstext.c:		Used fgets instead of GMT_fgets which could cause issues
				under Windoze.
	* gmtstitch.c:		Warn that segment with a single point will not connect both
				ends properly - you will need to rerun the task on the new
				sets of segments.  We now give a warning.

2011-07-14	pwessel
	* sph/sphtriangulate:	Passed lon,lat instead of lat,lon to GMT_geo_to_cart
				which would affect the -A option only.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2011-07-15	pwessel
	* GMT 4.5.7 finalized and released
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-07-14	pwessel
	* pslib.c:		The @-, @+, @# would reset size to original font size, ignoring
				any changes a @:<size>: sequence would have made.  Also, when
				@:<size>: was used the derived sizes for sub/super were not updated.

2011-07-13	remko
	* gmt_plot.c:		Force arcs to be counter-clockwise in GMT_pie and GMT_matharc.

2011-07-11	pwessel
	* install_gmt.sh:	Simplified GMT packaging to one tarball, with all of GSHHS in
				a separate tarball [similar for the Windows installers].

2011-07-11	remko
	* doc/GNUmakefile:	tex4ht now writes src="file" instead of src=file, so had to
				adjust sed script.

	* Makefile:		Updated doc directory.

2011-07-08	pwessel

2011-06-30	remko
	* share/doc/gmt/examples:	Moved to doc

2011-06-23	pwessel
	* gmt_shore.c:		Now reads new GSHHS 2.2.0 format that includes feature areas
				stored as doubles.  The old int(0.1*area) would set all
				areas < 0.1 km^2 to zero [only affected gshhs supplement].
				Areas were also recomputed to use WGS-84 ellipsoid (not sphere).
	* gshhs/gshhs.c:	Updated to handle GSHHS 2.2.0.	Also added -Amin to exclude
				smaller polygons on output and -G for special Octave/Matlab-
				formatted output [suggested by José Luis García Pallero],
				as well as -Q to control output of river-lakes and -N to
				control which levels to get.

2011-06-20	pwessel
	* *.c:			No longer use DIR_DELIM since / works for all.  Added path
				fixer to turn odd /c/dir/.. into c:/dir/..

2011-06-20	remko
	* gmt_notunix.h:	Only define PATH_SEPARATOR (as char), not also PATH_DELIM.

				and vice versa.

2011-06-12	pwessel
	* x2sys:		New test suite based on Wessel [2010] figure scripts.

2011-06-10	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		Clip path for van Grinten was wrong for global maps.

2011-06-08	pwessel
	* xgrid/xgrid_Panner.c:	Eliminate "cast to pointer from integer of different size"
				by casting the value via (ptrdiff_t) [Thanks to L. Parkes].

2011-06-07	pwessel
	* animations:		Add note that when run without any argument they produce just
				the first frame as PS.  With an arg we build the movie.
	* grdcontour.c:		Could crash if -C -A give no contours and we freed a non-allocated array.
				[Thanx to Walter Harms].

2011-06-05	pwessel
	* nearneighbor.c:	For global region in longitudes, cannot extend w/e limits
				as we do for Cartesian and region-limited areas.

2011-06-04	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		Eliminated notch in corners of linear map frames and color bars.

2011-06-01	pwessel
	* spotter/grdrotater.c:	Could end up with w=e=0 in some cases.
	* grdedit.c:		The -N option did not consider replicate w/e points for
				gridline-registered grids.
	* grdfilter.c:		Now gives consistent values at poles and along shared E/W cols.

2011-05-31	pwessel
	* grdfilter.c:		Convolution weights were y-transposed so gave wrong results
				at/near the poles for spherical filtering.  Also, some nodes
				were duplicated in the convolution, resulting in inconsistent
				values at the S or N pole.
	* grdlandmask.c:	Did not correctly truncate nodes for GSHHS bins with no data.

2011-05-26	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		GMT_wesn_clip needed to adjust longitudes to fit the given domain.

2011-05-25	pwessel
	* nearneighbor.c:	The -N1 selection did not reset the minimum sector setting to 1.

2011-05-23	jluis
	* xyz2grd.c:		Fixed bug when reading a file using -E option on Windows.
				The file was actually read with GMT_fopen and accessed with fgets

2011-05-11	remko
	* gmt_nc.c:		Ignore reading of node_offset attribute. Registration is now
				based on match between actual_range attributes and coordinate arrays.

2011-05-10	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Did not account for the doubling of a grid array for complex
				data when scaling data after read.  This made grdfft give
				odd results when grids with a scale other than 1 was read.
				Bug was first introduced in GMT 3.0 in 1995, making it a
				bug with seniority!

2011-05-09	pwessel
	* grdimage.c:		When image is grayscale and -Q is used then image must be
				converted to 24-bit and we set NaN color to a non-gray value.

2011-05-07	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Failed to create proper old-style v3 netcdf file if selected
				for the output in grdblend.

2011-05-03	pwessel
	* pstext.c:		The -A can reset the text angle but also needs to reset justification.

2011-05-03	remko
	* gmt_map.c, pstext.c:	Now allow negative azimuth in -E option.

2011-05-01	remko
	* script/*.sh:		Replaced ". functions.sh" by ". ./functions.sh" to avoid problems
				with people who do not have . in their PATH. E.g., Ubuntu.

2011-05-01	pwessel
	* job03.sh:		Replaced complicated awk scripting with gmtmath to ensure
				we get the common sampling range which changed by a tad
				due to the bug in project.

2011-04-20	remko
	* grdview.c:		grdview_init_setup produced an incorrect plot offset.

2011-04-17      pwessel
	* mapproject.c:		Kept treating x,y as lon,lat when -G[lon/lat/]c (c for Cartesian)
				were given.

2011-04-16      pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		The GMT_wesn_search did not handle periodic longitudes well,

	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	Ensure pen is given in points and >= 1 in width.
	* misc/gmt2kml.txt:	Explain how pen needs to be set.
	* pscontour.c:		Got wrong contour level when some segments along edges were skipped.

2011-03-28	remko
	* ps2raster.c:		Automatically add GS option -dMaxBitmap=100000000 with -TG to overcome
				gs bugs/limitations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2011-03-10	pwessel
	* GMT 4.5.6 finalized and released.  GMT cvs archive moved to GMT4.
	  GMT5 branch will be merged to new trunk and converted to subversion.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* configure.ac:		Check for bad 64-bit qsort under earlier OS X did not work.
				Needed to add -fno-common to CFLAGS under OS X Tiger

2011-03-06	pwessel
	* share/cpt:		GMT_jet.cpt had two bad values causing discontinuities.
	* mex/grdwrite.c:	Round-off could lead to false detection of a non-equally spaced grid.

2011-03-01	pwessel
	* GNUmakefile:		Added make get-gshhs-cvs to get the pre-release GSHHS from the
				pwessel ftp.  Updated gmt_shore.c message on this subject.

2011-03-01	remko

2011-02-28	remko
	* doc/* examples/*:	Run documentation and tests now as it is done in GMT5.

2011-02-27	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		Processing of mathangle symbol (-Sm[bfl]) confused the unit detector.
				Added test scripts to check for correct symbol size plotting
				under both CM and INCH environments.

2011-02-27	jluis
	* scripts/GMT_*.sh:	Replaced $AWK for awk since the $AWK variable was not
				set in those the scripts anyway.

2011-02-25	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_datalist.c:	When geographic data and -R it failed to consider periodic lons.
	* x2sys/x2sys_get.c:	The -N option did not work properly, and the reported Y|N flags

				SEMI-axes (docs said major/minor but code did semi.)

2011-02-22	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		The symbol_parsing for psxy[z] did not properly set the
				column types when no symbol size was given.  This affected
				symbols that require angles (-Sw, -SE, -SJ) when unit was SI.

2011-02-17	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		The -: option messed up the column type arrays; should
				only swap x|y data columns, not type columns.

2011-02-16	jluis

2011-01-17	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_init.c:	Did not write both of -Nd -Ns to the tag file.

2011-01-11	remko
	* ps2raster.c:		Bug fix after last -F option update
	* gmt_map.c:		Fixed bug in Haversine equation for duplicate point.

2011-01-09	pwessel
	* triangulate.c:	Did not use projected coordinates when -R -J was given.

2011-01-07	pwessel
	* ps2raster.c:		Must pass the optional -C args when calculating BB.
				Added -dSAFER as well, + fix -F option [F. Wobbe].
	* gmtswitch:		Requires bash.

2011-01-04	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_cspline should initialize c[0] = c[n-1] = 0.0 in case
				it is called repeatedly [not the case in GMT].

2011-01-03	pwessel
	* autoconf.ac:		Moving to use GSHHS 2.1.1 for next release.
	* gmt_shore.c:		---"---

2010-12-31	pwessel
	* x2sys_init.c:		Crashed if -D was not given [should imply -DTAG].

2010-12-29	pwessel
	* psscale.c:		Now patterns have constant orientation regardless of using
				horizontal or vertical bar.

2010-12-20	remko
	* meca/utilmeca.c:		Patch to fix incorrect plotting of moment tensors with big
				isotropic components. Thanks to Jeremy Pesicek.

2010-12-17	pwessel
	* grdfilter.c:		Allow -D2 and -D3 to handle periodic and polar boundary conditions.

2010-12-15	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	When calculating how far to place an annotation from the tick mark
				we must check if a fancy frame width exceeds the tick length.
2010-12-13	pwessel
	* splitxyz.c:		Did not list -Q in synopsis.
	* surface.c:		Bug if using seconds (c) in search radius (got minutes).
	* *.txt:		Fixed typos in several man pages.

2010-12-13	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		For some reason -W was not forcing -A. Now it does it again

2010-12-11	pwessel
	* pslegend.c:		One more place to use original -R -J (see 2010-11-18 fix).
	* gmt_map.c:		For van Grinten: errors in left/right_circle
	* gmt_plot.c:		A colored TICK_PEN would also color annotations.

2010-12-05	pwessel
	* spotter/grdrotater.c:	Did not handle the rotation of an entire global grid since
				the polygon outline interfered with the domain.

2010-12-02	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys.c:	Minor bug in x2sys binary reading of floats.

2010-11-30	pwessel
	* xyz2grd.c:		Do not tolerate NaNs in x,y and give error (e.g., if junk is given).

2010-11-23	pwessel
	* grdmask.c:		Must skip "polygons" with less than 3 points.  Also, the
				resampling distance for spherical data was wrong, now 0.1 degrees.
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	Options -N+ and -D would crash under Windows (usual DLL hell).

2010-11-19	pwessel
	* grd2xyz.c:		Extended -Ef mode to write floats (patch by Pierre Cazenave).
	* gmtselect.c:		Due to resampling of parallels in -N, some points exactly on
				a coast bin parallel could fail the test due to roundoff.
				Fixed by not resampling coastlines since it is a Cartesian test.
	* grdlandmask.c:	Same.

2010-11-18	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		When ASCII mode, also need to save/restore any netcdf i/o settings.
	* gmt_map.c:		We have a safety valve for preventing a painful slow search
				around the map perimeter.  The search is appropriate for maps
				but not for mapproject results.  The limit was for 200 inch
				wide maps == 14400p.  A user ran pscoast with 14401p and was
				caught.  Now check for 400 inch and also check current page
				size (PAPER_MEDIA). If map width vastly outsizes the paper
				size then it is probably a projection job.
	* pslegend.c:		Need to keep the original -R around since it may be -R....r
	* xyz2grd.c:		Failed if -Evalue was given and the ESRI grid already had a
				nodata_value line.  Now will process this line, if present.
				The value given on the command line will override any setting
				found in the file.  Also made string-checks case-insensitive.
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_inonout_sphpol_count failed to detect crossings if a
				polygon had vertical line-segments with same longitude as
				the point we were testing.

2010-11-16	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		Tried to free an unallocated array in GMT_draw_custom_symbol.

2010-11-15	pwessel
	* grdproject.c:		Now assign proper x/y units.

2010-11-12	pwessel
	* spotter/rotconverter.c:	Forgot to skip args when -N or -S was used.

2010-11-10	pwessel
	* nearneighbor.c:	Changed default to a more reasonable -N4/2.

2010-11-05	jluis

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2010-10-29	pwessel
	* ex??/job??.[c]sh:	Many used awk instead of $AWK

2010-10-28	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		Could not use @:<size>: and @:: in -B strings as the colons
				interfered with the :label: parsing.  Now fixed.

2010-10-27	pwessel
	* psmask.c:		Did not update internal clip level (if -T not used) do could
				not warn if clipping had not been properly terminated.

2010-10-26	pwessel
	* mapproject.c:		When -L is used with -fg and an ellipsoid we convert lats

				convert back to geodetic coordinates.

2010-10-24	jluis
	* gmtdefaults:		Still had one free() that should be GMT_free (Win crash)

2010-10-19	pwessel
	* gmtswitch:		Given D it picks the first entry in .gmtversions. Also
				is now installed with rest of scripts and executables.

				Corrected synopsis, usage, and man page.

2010-10-17	pwessel
	* grdpaste.c:		Lacked -fg so could not paste 352/360 and 0/8 in longitudes.

2010-10-14	pwessel
	* psbasemap.c:		The -L option had trouble parsing if there were + signs

2010-09-03	pwessel
	* misc/gmtstitch.c:	Could crash if -C was used.

2010-08-30	pwessel

2010-08-19	pwessel
	* gmt_plot.c:		map_latline/lonline tried to draw a 2-point line when
				no points were defined.  Checks that we have at least 2 points
	* psxy.c:		The -Ap|m options were ignored since the mode was not checked.
	* grdmask.c:		---"---

	* gmt_plot.c:		Bug in fault symbol psxy -Sfrc, fixed w/ thanx to J. Robert

2010-07-28	pwessel
	* spotter/rotconverter.c:	Complained of "bad option" when a rotation with a
				negative longitude was given on the command line, e.g. -135/35/-2.5
				Would sometimes issue a rotation twice (same time)

2010-07-27	pwessel
	* spotter/backtracker.c:	Added the -F option to compute predicted hotspot tracks
				given a hotspot motion record and plate rotations.

2010-07-26	pwessel

				in the man pages.  Also -Fall+ and -Fmgd77+ did not append
				the auxiliary columns properly.
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	The -D failed on numeric arguments.

2010-07-22	pwessel
	* psimage.c:		justify text string must be 3-char longs to hold trailing 0.
				This could cause SEGV on some systems.

	* gmt_plot.c:		Ensure that axis vector for GRAPH mode matches axis pen width.

2010-07-13	remko
	* gmt_plot.c, gmt_map.c:	Replace GMT_coordinate_to_[xy] by already existing
				GMT_x_to_xx and GMT_y_to_yy.

2010-07-08	pwessel
	* ex13:			Used -G2i/10 which is a syntax from pre-GMT 4.  Changed to -Gd2i.

				fractional part.
	* gmt_support.c:	Now complains if -Gd<dist>[/<frac>] finds frac outside 0-1.

2010-07-05	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		Also converts ps files with headers but no image. Now it will
				create a 1x1 raster instead of aborting with an error message.

2010-06-29	pwessel
	* grdcontour.c:		Placement of H and L annotations improved by using centroids

2010-06-28	pwessel

				may have a suffix unit (e.g., 3.5c).  This can occur in the
				input to psxy[z], which sometimes complained about bad input.
	* psxy[z].c:		Better handling of dimensions with units passed via columns
				in the data file, as in psxy.

2010-06-25	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		GMT_fgets now checks for input record truncation and handles
				this gracefully (gives warning and winds to next record).

2010-06-21	pwessel
	* job??.*, *.sh:	All examples with gridded files now use the extension .nc and not .grd

2010-06-16	pwessel
	* WDBII:		Based on feedback (and data) from Branislav Mikulas I have added some

				inside the dll and no crash on Windows.

2010-05-19	pwessel
	* pswiggle.c:		Option -Dx<gap> allows gaps to be in projected distances.

				(fix by Marcelo Banik)
	* share/mgd77:		Updated F107_mon.plt and Dst_all.wdc index files to March/April 2010.
				In umdl.CM4 file, extended the limit of the 'bkpo' indices from 2010 to 2015.
				This should make no difference to core field estimation that ends at 2002.5
				but lets the atmospheric components be computed after 1-Jan-2010.

2010-03-17	pwessel
	* psxy.c:		The -Sw/W symbols did not handle the azimuth/direction conversions
				properly.
	* psxyz.c:		The -Sw/W machinery mistakenly converted angles to radians before
				passing arguments to the plot functions.

2010-03-15	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		Added GMT_io.skip_duplicates [FALSE] to control if consecutive
				records with identical x,y should be skipped.  This is needed
				by programs that uses GMT_sph_inonout, which does not expect to
				find duplicates vertices.
	* gmtselect.c:		Turns skip_duplicates on before reading polygons
	* grdmask.c:		Turns skip_duplicates on before reading polygons
	* grdmath.c:		Turns skip_duplicates on before reading polygons

				other than an annoying "Cannot find track =tracks" message.

2010-02-28	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		GMT_wesn_clip function would clip polygons even though
				there were no restrictions on longitudes (w/e = 360).

2010-02-26	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys.c:	Reading of data formats .gmt and custom returned all columns and
				not just the requested columns, causing errors upstream.
	* x2sys/x2sys_datalist.c:	Check to see if both lon and lat had been requested only
				checked for longitude (twice).
	* mgg/mgd77togmt.c:	Now has proper synopsis

	* gmt_support.c:	Further improved internals of GMT_contour, GMT_trace_contour,
				GMT_splice_contour, significantly reducing amount of code lines.
				Removed GMT_start_contour.

2010-02-14	remko
	* grdcontour.c:		Reverting change of 2010-01-28 because closing a contour
				crossing east-to-west or west-to-east also causes lines drawn across

2010-02-13	pwessel
	* greenspline.c:	Must insist that one of [-R -I], -N, or -T is specified.

2010-02-11	remko

				limited to 64-bit.

2010-01-24	jluis
	* meca/submeca.c:	Replaced calls to d_atan2() by d_atan2d() since the code expects
				angles in degrees. Thanks to Dan Scheirer for finding this.

				--enable-cygloc option when running configure.
2010-01-13	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		The .gmtdefaults4 file was assumed to be in UNIX EOL format.

2009-11-15	jluis
	* x2sys/x2sys_list.c:	Weights were not written out when names were selected as well,
				as in -Fncw

2009-11-12	pwessel
	* fitcircle.c:		Now, -S optionally takes a latitude instead of finding
				the best-fitting latitude.
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:	Add attribute array of TZ corrections for the few cruises
				that stored TZ and local time instead of UTC time.

2009-11-08	pwessel
	* gmt_shore.[ch]:	Changes to accommodate new GSHHS2.0.2 netcdf files
				which needed more metadata to properly compute the

				instructions on how to ftp.
	* grdgradient.c:	Now, -Lg will imply -fg to properly set geographic units
				Fixed bug where the gradient at the S pole was not
				replicated to x = east.

2009-11-07	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		GMT_access did not check for NULL filename

2009-11-07	remko
	* pslib.c:		Ellipse was wrongly dimensioned by semi-major and semi-
				minor axes, instead of major and minor axes.
2009-11-05	pwessel
	* imgsrc/img2google:	One gmtmath call did not have -Q

2009-10-11	pwessel
	* misc/kml2gmt.c:	Mix of fopen and GMT_fclose not good under Windoze

2009-10-09	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		If GMT_DATADIR was set to a list of colon-separated dirs
				then then init failed since we tried to check access as
				if GMT_DATADIR was always a single entity (as in the past).

2009-10-06	remko
	* gmt2kml.c:		Removed additional > in </ExtendedData>>.

2009-10-04	pwessel

2009-10-03	pwessel
				GMT 5 branch tag set: GMT5_branch

2009-10-01	remko
	* explain_-J*.txt:	Added necessary / after -Jpoly
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	Removed rogue \n before </coordinates>\n.

2009-09-29	pwessel
	* install_gmt:		GDAL setup had bad variable name $enable-gdal that
				was meant to be $enable_gdal, and a bad if-test.

2009-09-28	jluis
	* x2sys/x2sys_merge.c:	Improved updating algorithm for detected cases where
				where it was failing badly.

2009-09-27	pwessel
	* gmt_init.c:		Bug in the parsing of -Jg<lon>/<lat>/<radius>/<lat>.
	* spotter/backtracker.c:	When -L is set, -mo must be turned on automatically
					even if -m is not set.

2009-09-25	pwessel
	* gmtconvert.c:		The -S option failed for actual matches; the 2009/5/26
				change screwed that up.  Now fixed and tested.
	* spotter/rotconverter.c:	New option -E to reduce stage pole opening
					angles by <fact> [0.5] (to get half-spreading rates)

2009-09-17	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_get.c:	The -L option failed if list contained file extensions
2009-09-15	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_solve.c:	Did not allocate array for weights.
	* pswiggle.c:		Incorrectly computed distances with -Jx<scale>d.

2009-09-13	pwessel
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	Avoid mixing stdout/GMT_stdout as Windoze is Windoze.
	* misc/kml2gmt.c:	Avoid mixing stdout/GMT_stdout as Windoze is Windoze.

2009-09-12	pwessel
	* spotter:		Failed in 64-bit mode due to variable mismatch:
	* spotter/backtracker.c:	Needed GMT_LONG variables to be passed to GMT libs
	* spotter/hotspotter.c:		Needed GMT_LONG variables to be passed to GMT libs
	* spotter/originator.c:		Needed GMT_LONG variables to be passed to GMT libs

2009-09-11	remko
	* gmtdefaults_*.in:	Enter TRANSPARENCY = 0; replaced color triplets by names.
	* gmt_init.c:		Let gmtdefaults output TRANSPARENCY and print colors as names
				if available.
	* gmt_support.c:	Added GMT_getrgb_index to get index of preset RGB triplets.
	* gmt_{init,map.c}:	When using -JX, give width or height as 0 and it will adjust to

2009-09-10	pwessel
	* grdcontour.c:		The -L option was not used in limiting contours.

2009-09-10	remko

				with Adobe Distiller (only?).
	* gmt_plot.c, gmtdefaults.txt, gmt.h, gmt_globals.h, gmt_keywords.d:	---"---
	* psclip.c, pscoast.c:	Replaced booleans GMT_ps.clip_on and GMT_ps.clip_off with single
				GMT_ps.clip with values -1, 0 or +1.
	* configure.ac, all makefiles:	Needed to redo the way GDAL_INC and GDAL_LIB are inserted.
				-I (without anything) of -L (without anything) when GDAL is not
				enabled makes compiling impossible. So *_LIB and *_INC (also
				NETCDF) now include the -I and -L/-l flags.

2009-09-10	jluis
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	It now lets the Core field be computed with the IGRF and added
				to the atmospheric sources calculated with CM4. We added
				this because the secular variation in CM4 is limited to 2002.5
				but the "atmospheric coefficients" can be continuously updated

2009-09-09	pwessel
	* LICENSE.TXT:		Replaced file COPYING with LICENSE.TXT and clarified we are
	  			using GPL v2 as displayed in all source files.

	* gmt_customio.c:	Made surfer grid header i/o 64-bit compliant

2009-09-06	jluis
	* nc2xy.c:		Added -b option (of which only -bo makes sense)

2009-09-06	remko
	* configure.ac:		Now use --enable-flock to enable file locking, instead of
				--disable-flock to disable if.
				Use --enable-64 to force 64-bit compilation, use --disable-64
				to force 32-bit compilation. Otherwise use default.
				Switch -DGMT_QSORT on only for OSX prior to Snow Leopard.

2009-09-04	pwessel
	* gmt.h:		Now has GMT_abs macro that handles abs/labs use

2009-09-04	remko
	* gmt_map.[ch]:		Changed GMT_truncate from being a pointer function (PFL)
				to a regular function that simply calls GMT_truncate_x
				or GMT_truncate_tm depending on whether projection is TM.
				This to avoid problems with calling GMT_truncate with
				constant argument -1 in 64-bit machines.
	* gmt_shore.c, psmask.c, gmt.h, gmt_globals.h:	---"---
	* pscoast.c:		Added mention of debugging options when DEBUG is on.
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_log_array: Recoded to avoid 64-bit error (last value was not
				included).
				GMT_pow_array, GMT_log_array: Simplified code.
				GMT_memory: Now free memory when reallocating memory with size 0.

2009-08-27	jluis
	* gmt_gdalread.[ch]:	Wrapper function to interface with the GDAL library
	* grdimage.c:		Modified (with #ifdefs) to allow minimalist images import
				using GDAL, via the gmt_gdalread function.
	* gmt_support.c:	Fixed bug in x_inc adjust. It was cosd (0.5 * (h->x_min + h->x_max))
				Instead of cosd (0.5 * (h->y_min + h->y_max))

2009-08-20	remko
	* pslib.c, pslib_inc.h:	ps_place_color now also adds the "set...color" operator, so

2009-08-17	remko
	* gmt_plot.c, GMT_Chapter_{3,6}.tex:	Documentation on -JPoly added.

2009-08-15	remko
	* gmt_proj.[ch], gmt_map.c, gmt_init.c:	First stab at introducing polyconic projection.
				Not documented yet, but seems to work (-JPoly).

2009-07-24	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	The routine that checks if a points is inside or outside a
				polar cap had trouble when the points longitude exactly
				equalled a point on the polygon since round-off would
				cause our test to fail.  Now hopefully fool-proof.
2009-07-23	pwessel
	* psmask.c:		With -D, the internal di,dj constant was set way too large.

2009-07-22	pwessel
	* gmt_shore.[ch]:	The -A+r|+l option was premature as more info in the GSHHS
				netcdf files are needed to properly skip features.  GSHHS 2.0.1
				will have this information so pscoast et al need to check
				for versions before attempting to use any of the +<modifiers>

2009-07-18	mtchandl
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:	Bug in -I option; needed to set bitpattern for bad faa.

2009-07-10	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		GMT_font_lookup now understands font numbers too.
	* psscale.c:		Added -Aa and -Al options to move only the annotations or label to the
				other side of the color bar. When using -A on horizontal bar, the last
				tick mark would not appear. Require -Ac to keep the column plotting
				of vertical labels.
	* pslegend.c:		Make font height dependent on actual font used.

2009-07-09	pwessel
	* gmt_mgg_header2.c:	Can now handle float grids, and properly handles byte-order swapping in input.
	* segyprogs/pssegy.c:	Casting as long forced 8 rather than 4-byte offsets. Thanx to Adrian Benson.

	* grdfilter.c:		Toggle -T was not processed correctly if -Rgridfile was given.
	* mgd77list.c:		Output relative time did not use GMT's --TIME_*

2009-06-27	remko
	* gmt_init.c (GMT_history):	No longer remove supposedly empty .gmtcommands4 file.
				Could have been written to by piped GMT command. Now create/write
				only when new matter is to be written.

2009-06-25	pwessel
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Change for reasonable x/y range if units has the words "longitude"
				or "latitude" before concluding we have geodetic coordinates.
	* gmt_support.c:	The modifier :<radius>[unit] to the -G option in grdcontour for
				the placement of contour labels is now +r<radius>[unit] since the
				colon interfered with ddd:mm:ss coordinates.

2009-06-24	jluis
	* x2sys/x2sys_merge.c:	New program to merge updated COEs table into a main COE table database
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Do not use any GMT_XXX to access ascii files on creation/writing so that
				it can work on Windows as well (improvement on 2009-06-07 changes).

2009-06-18	pwessel
	* misc/gmtstitch.c:	Enhanced -T option to eliminate connections when the 2nd closest
				pair is too close.  Also added -C option to simply separate the
				open from the closed polygons (no stitching).

2009-06-17	pwessel
	* grdfft.c:		Now also has Butterworth band-pass filter.

2009-06-17	remko

				Write out <gx:altitudeMode> when required.
				Removed -AG, -AS; use -Ag0, -As0 instead. Allow vertical scaling.

				annotate every n'th power of 10.
	* misc/gmtstitch.c:	Now honors -V properly.

2009-06-11	remko
	* gmt_nc.c:		No longer write node_offset = 0 to file (not essential, only confusing).
	* gmt_grdio.c:		GMT_grd_setregion now includes "interpolant" argument: this ensures
				enough padding (if available) from the input grid and no blank edges
				on left and/or right side of the map.
				More appropriate coding of GMT_grd_shift.
				GMT_adjust_loose_wesn now includes test on data domain (moved from main
				programs calling it).
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_RI_prepare recoded. Possibly safer. Need to investigate if it can
				be skipped when nx and ny already set.
	* grd2xyz.c:		Area check moved to GMT_adjust_loose_wesn.
	* grdvector.c, grdrotater.c, grdview.c, grdcontour.c, grdimage.c:
				Extra argument in GMT_grd_setregion. No more subset checks needed.

2009-06-09	pwessel
	* misc/gmtdp.c:		With -m, did not write the correct multisegment header from input.

2009-06-07	jluis
	* mgd77/mgd77info.c:	Use of both printf() and internal functions that write to GMT_stdout
				seams to be incompatible on Windows. Now always use fprintf (GMT_stdout, ...)
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Open ascii files with fopen (and not GMT_fopen) because they are written
				with fprintf(F->fp, ...) and Windows, again, gets lost.

2009-06-07	remko
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Fixed bug in GMT_grd_setregion: longitudes were limited inward
				instead of outward. Caused white-space left and right in grdimage.

2009-06-03	pwessel
	* pscoast.c:		-C[l|r/]<fill> offers to paint river-lakes separately from lakes.
				The -A option can be used to exclude riverlakes or lakes for level 2.
				-W now allows different pens for the 4 levels of lines.
	* explain_gshhs.txt:	New include file for man pages for programs using GSHHS.
	* gmtselect.c:		Same upgrade to -A option as pscoast
	* grdlandmask.c:	Same upgrade to -A option as pscoast
	* gmt_init.c:		New function GMT_GSHHS_syntax to explain -A option for three programs.
	* gmt_shore.c:		Now looks for a version attribute in the GSHHS file that is reported
				when pscoast -Vl is used.  New treatment of riverlakes as special lakes.
	* gshhs/gshhs.*:	Header structure format for GSHHS 1.11 has changed to include two new
				integers: parent (the id of the containing polygon, or -1), and river
				(1 if a lake is a riverlake, 0 otherwise).
	* GSHHS*:		New version 1.11 that fixes the problem with permanent rivers introduced
				after GMT 4.2.0.  Also corrects gross errors near the mouth of the
				Amazon river.  GMT works with either GSHHS 1.11 or earlier but any
				option pertaining to riverlakes are ignored with older versions.
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Converting files from netCDF to MGD77 where time = NaN gave junk records.
	* misc/dimfilter.c:	New program for directional spatial filtering.

2009-06-02	remko
	* pslegend.c:		> record no longer needed before T; T, L, S, H alignment harmonized;
				I, M, B spacing improved; -B option added.
	* pslegend.txt:		Updated example conform test/pslegend/legend.sh; added info on which
				font(size)s are used; added -B option.

2009-05-31	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		Option -g must force -mo; fixed bug that reset point number in segment.
	* misc/gmtstitch.c:	Added -L option to write out segment-link information.

2009-05-29	jluis
	* gmt_init.c:		Do not create empty .gmtcommands4 files

2009-05-28	remko
	* gmtselect.c:		Switches off just_copy_record when using netCDF I/O. Otherwise no
				output was produced. Unfortunately does not yet take into account
				that using -fit and -foT would require reformatting.

2009-05-27	pwessel
	* misc/gmtstitch.c:	Did not read standard input if no files were given.

2009-05-26	pwessel
	* gmtconvert.c:		With -S, did not report the number of output segments.  Now allows
				-S~<pattern> which reports segments whose header does NOT contain pattern.
				Should pattern actually start with ~ we escape it with \~pattern.

2009-05-25	pwessel
	* greenspline.c:	Calculation of nz layers was off by one, leaving out the
				penultimate layer.

2009-05-23	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:	Now uses GMT_read_img to handle *.img files; earlier it could
				not handle the latest +-80 degree lats.  Also passed wrong filename variable.

2009-05-21	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		When only -mi is set there should be no multisegment headers on output
					but there was no if-test to check for that.

2009-05-21	remko
	* bin/*:		Removed bin directory from CVS.
	* gmtlogo, gmtget, psbbox.sh:	Moved to src directory. Created manuals for them.
	* gmtpatch.sh:		Moved to main directory.

2009-05-20	pwessel
	* psclip.c:		New option -T that turns on map region clipping without any
				input data files.  Shorthand for -N /dev/null.
	* x2sys/x2sys_list.c:	Can now accept list of weights for each track and output the
				composite weight for each crossover.
	* x2sys/x2sys_solve.c:	Option -W means an extra column with crossover weight.

2009-05-19	pwessel
	* misc/gmt2kml.c:	New program in the misc supplement that converts GMT table
				data to KML format for Google Earth.
	* misc/kml2gmt.c:	New programs that extracts GMT data tables from Google Earth
				KML files, perhaps after editing the latter in GE.

2009-05-19	remko
	* grd2xyz.c:		Fixed checking East boundary (bug introduced 2008-03-05).

2009-05-17	jluis
	* gmt_notunix.h:	Declare HAVE_SINCOS 1 when #ifdef __INTEL_COMPILER (the Intel
				compiler also provides a sincos function)
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	Use sincos()

2009-05-14	remko
	* grdinfo.{c,txt}:	Add option -L0 to actually scan data to determine zmin and zmax
	* gmt_nc.c:		Argument [layer] was not stripped from varname and would end up
				in output grid.  Set zmin/zmax to NaN when info not in header.

2009-05-13	pwessel
	* *.[ch]:		Moving to use GMT_LONG for almost all integers.

2009-05-12	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_UTMzone_to_wesn):	Numerous bug fixes: Did not report bad zone
				for < A or > Z; Zones A+B reached till 84S instead of 80S; Zone J
				wrongly produced value for Zone K; Zones U+W were not recognized;
				Now also equates Zone O to Zone P (already equated Zone I to J).

2009-05-08	remko
	* gmtconvert.c:		Switch off default NaN treatment when NAN_RECORDS=pass and no
				multi-segment output is requested.
	* gmt_init.c:		Renamed GRID_FORMAT to GRIDFILE_FORMAT to avoid confusion with
				other GRID_* variables which relate to painting grids, and in
				accordance with GRIDFILE_SHORTHAND.
				GRID_FORMAT can still be used for backwards compatibility.
				Allow different units for font sizes. Default remains points.
				GMT_convert_units: add 10 to new_format to specify it as
				default unit as well.
	* gmt_keywords.d, gmt.h, gmt_grdio.h, gmt_globals.h, gmtdefaults.txt, gmtdefaults_??.in:
				Changed accordingly.
	* gmtdefaults.txt:	Properly alphabetized entries.
	* pslib.c:		Removed superfluous writing of "P\n" from ps_clipon.
				Removed obsolete "split" argument from ps_line().
	* pslib.h, *.c:		Changed accordingly.

2009-05-07	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		For wesn clipping with curved boundaries, needed a more robust
				Sutherland/Hodgman algorithm that handles curved boundaries.
	* gmt_io.c:		GMT_DATADIR can now be a list of directories, separated by colons
				or semi-colons (Windows).
	* mgd77list.c:		Used wrong time for IGRF calculation; worst case off by 1 year.
	* mgd77manage.c:	---"---

2009-05-06	pwessel
	* *.c, *.txt, *.tex:	While remaining backwards compatible, we no longer announce that
				GMT will search GMT_IMGDIR and GMT_GRIDDIR.  Going forward, we will
				document the user of GMT_DATADIR and GMT_USERDIR only.

2009-05-06	remko
	* pglegend.c:		Allow S record not to have <text>. Until now, when left empty would
				use whatever <text> was set to in previous record.
	* pslegend.txt:		Changed accordingly, plus some additional polishing.
	* GMT_sealand.cpt:	Changed hue interval on one line from 0-345 to 360-345 to prevent
				wrong interpolation.
	* GMT_cyclic.cpt:	Reduced to one line.
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_continuous based on HSV (not RGB) values when read as HSV.

2009-05-03	jluis
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	Fixed bug in MGD77_igrf10syn routine (mistake done while cleaning the
				f2c version) that resulted in altitude always being on Earth surface
				when geocentric coords were used.

2009-05-03	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77magref.c:	New mgd77 program used to evaluate the CM4 comprehensive geomagnetic
				model, a more sophisticated alternative to IGRF, or IGRF.  Based on
				a f2c translation of NASA Fortran code by J. Luis.

2009-05-01	pwessel
	* pslib.c:		Check if input arg eps == NULL before using this pointer

2009-04-30	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		Incorrectly used central longitude to set default midpoint for 3-D maps
				using the -E...+ mechanism when data were not geographic.

2009-04-29	remko
	* PSL_prologue.ps:	Changed "bind def" to "def" in function /FS. The "bind def" slowed
				things down significantly when there are a lot of color changes.
	* pslib.c:		Changed accordingly (PSL_prologue version number).

2009-04-27	pwessel
	* dbase/grdraster.c:	Added sanity check on file size.

	* gmt_customio.c:	In GMT_ras_read_grd_info, wrong size was passed to fread.
	* mgd77/mgd77list.c:	Used GMT_LONG in memset for an array allocated as int.

2009-04-16	pwessel
	* *.txt:		We now discuss -m rather than -M (but are backwards compatible)
	* job*:			All examples now use -m
	* *.tex, *.man:		All documentation now use -m

2009-04-16	remko
	* psclip.c, pscoast.c:	Produce at least "S V" when clippath is empty.
	* gmt_plot.c (GMT_xyz_axis3D):	Bug fix: Call GMT_get_coordinate_label() with
				&GMT_plot_calclock instead of NULL. Crashed when using time labels
				in 3D plot.

2009-04-15	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		Add handling of -M|m by GMT_parse_common_options.
	* *.c:			Removed call to GMT_multisegment. -M|m now handled as common option.

				(n > 0), otherwise crash when using xx[n-1].

2009-04-13	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_map_init_{albers,econic}):	Fixed inability to determine projection
				pole when central_meridian and western boundary are the same.

2009-04-11	remko
	* gmt.h, gmtmath.c, grdmath.c:	Added MOD function (remainder after floored division,
				Knuth style). This is in contrast to FMOD which gives the
				remainder after (horror) truncated division.
	* gmtmath.c:		For check if argument is file: remove suffix ?fields first.

2009-04-10	remko
	* Makefile, configure.ac, makegmt.macros.in:	Moved definition of SUPPL from Makefile
				to makegmt.macros.in. No more need to use .skip file for skipped

	* gmt_support.c:	The 3-D view -E option used in many programs (such as psxyz)
				could not handle exponential notations.
	* gmt_init.c:		The NAN_RECORDS = skip|pass setting now also applies to binary input.

2009-04-07	remko
	* configure.ac:		Auto detect octave and/or matlab directories.
				Do not say "yes" to compilation when supplement not available.

2009-04-05	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:		The -D option would remove original attributes.  Now
				both original and revised attributes are carried in memory.
				This problem also affected mgd77convert -FC if used on a
				file after mgd77manage -D had been run.
2009-03-31	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_get_datum):	Reuse GMT_get_ellipsoid to capture <a>,<inv_f> format.
	* gmt_init.c:		Changed custom ELLIPSOID format to <a>[,<inv_f>|b=<b>|f=<f>].
				Properly write out custom ELLIPSOID into .gmtdefaults4.

2009-03-30	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77.c:	To avoid Windows crashes, made sure free and GMT_free are
				used on the items allocated by strdup or GMT_memory, resp.

	* gmt_init.c (GMT_get_ellipsoid):	When importing ellipsoid file, allow a,0,0;
				a,0,f; a,b,0; or a,b,f as ellipsoid parameters.
				If file does not exist, attempt to read name as a[/[b=|f=]f],
				meaning <semi-major axis>, b=<semi-minor axis>, f=<flattening>,

	* gmt_defaults.txt:	Adjusted accordingly. Also specified SEMI-major/minor axis.
	* gmt.h:		Removed pol_radius from ELLIPSOID structure. Never used.
	* Ellipsoids.txt:	Added Moon and planets (IAU2000).
				Allow 0, b, or 1/f as second ellipsoid parameter.
	* src/GNUmakefile:	Adjusted accordingly.
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_set_spherical):	Take mean radius from CURRENT ellipsoid setting.
				Call GMT_init_ellipsoid again, so also GMT_[K]M_PR_DEG get set.

2009-03-28	pwessel
	* imgsrc/img2google:	Added new script (modified from David Sandwell's prototype)
				that creates Google Earth overlay tiles from topo.11.1.img

				else. Or leave them off altogether!

2009-03-24	pwessel
	* sph:			Introduce new GMT supplement sph which provide GMT-like
				front-ends for Robert Renka's Fortran SSRFPACK and STRIPACK
				libraries.  They are here translated to C via f2c and requires
				the f2c library and include file to compile and link.
				Tools include sphtriangulate (Delaunay and Voronoi spherical
				diagrams), sphdistance (spherical distances from lines to
				grid nodes using Voronoi partitioning), and spinterpolate

2009-03-23	pwessel
	* triangulate.c:	New option -Q to generate Voronoi polygon edges.
	* gmt_support.c:	Rely on Shewchuk's triangle function to get Voronoi output.

	* gmt_support.c:	Enabled GMT_intpol to handle NaNs by treating them as segment
				boundaries.
	* gmt_init.c:		New Default setting NAN_RECORDS = skip|pass [skip].
				If "pass" we treat let the programs handle the NaNs; for some
				programs the NaNs in input record will act as indicators of
				data gaps for continuous lines.  If "skip" we report them
				as bad records.  In both cases the records are skipped.
	* mgd77/mgd77manage.c:	Now honors NAN_RECORDS in tables given to -A.

2009-03-18	jluis

	* grdmath.c:		The PDIST operator did not handle binary input files (as LDIST does).

2009-03-08	jluis
	* gmt_support.{c,h}:	New function GMT_chop_ext() to remove the extension from filename string
	* mgg/gmt_mgg.c:	New -T and -W options to store total field and account for the
				magnetometer tow distance. Also tries to get info from header file.

				Added -Eb to get box-and-whisker output (0. 25, 50, 75, and 100% quantiles).

2009-03-05	jluis
	* ps2raster.c:		Added -Wg to create a simple KML file for Google Earth.
				Recognize -Jx<scale> (e.g. no 'd') as a linear geographic
				projection when -R<region> fits inside a sane ([-180 360][-90 90])
				interval (when -W is used).

2009-03-04	pwessel
	* mgd77/mgd77list.c:	Now can specify -DA and -DB which, in the presence of time = NaN,
				will not output such records [-Da|b will].  Also clarified the
				ranges implied by -D/-S.
	* blockm*.c:		Gave bogus usage about number of input columns when -E is set
				but -E only affects output.  Input is always 3 or 4 cols.

2009-03-04	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_grd_project):	Incorrectly attempted to free array only used when
				antialias is on.
	* gmt_proj.c (GMT_ilamb_sph):	Fixed bug in longitude computation when standard

	* gmt.h:		Introduced degree-based inverse trig functions: asind, acosd,
				atand, atan2d as well as their "safe" equivalents.
	* coast/segment_connect.c:	Simplified i_great_circle_dist() by calling
				GMT_great_circle_dist().
	* gmt_map.c:		Fixed serious bug in GMT_az_backaz_flatearth: incorrectly
				converted degrees to radians. Fixed bug in GMT_get_rotate_pole:
				called GMT_rotate_pole_forward with radians instead of degrees.
				project_info.o_{beta,pole_lat,pole_lon} now in degrees.
				GMT_fix_up_path: all arithmetic now in degrees.
	* project.c:		Avoid changing variables in the control list (Ctrl);
				this may have been harmful in the future (GMT5).
				Removed "rads" argument from internal routines since it was
				always TRUE anyhow. All routines are now in degrees.
	* gmt_vector.[ch]:	GMT_geo_to_cart no longer alters the input coordinates.
				This is a lot safer in usage.
	* *.c:			Use degree-based trig function macros where appropriate.
				Changed calls to GMT_geo_to_cart.

2009-02-24	jluis

				which takes precedence over the values in %%BoundingBox.

2008-07-15	pwessel

	* Win installer:	Now installs the GMT include files so users can build their own
				programs that use the GMT libs

2008-05-29	pwessel
	* grdreformat.c:	There is no longer a share/conf/gmt_formats.conf so the

				grdreformat.h created by GNUmakefile to include this info.

2008-05-27	pwessel
	* grdfilter.c:		The -D5 did not initialize xscale so filter search box was
				set to region width which typically is much larger.  The bug
				did not affect the results but unnecessarily increased runtime.
2008-05-27	remko

				i/o and at least 2 (3 with -Z) columns are found.
	* gmt_mgg2_header.c:	Passed 2nd, 3rd arguments to fread in the wrong order, thus
				failed to read GRD98 grids.
	* gmt_init.c:		Now, media size Custom_WxH can use W and H in inch, cm, or m
				by appending i, c, or m to each dimension.

2008-05-05	pwessel

	* GMT_eckert.sh:	Removed. Was not used by anything.
	* GMT_gall_stereo.sh:	Added example for -JCyl_stere.
	* GMT_Chapter_6*.tex:	Added more information on optional -J parameters. Added some
				historical background.

2008-04-26	pwessel
	* README etc:		Updated to reflect recent changes such as only *.bz2 archives
				and references to Windows installers.
	* grdview.c:		The -Qc option failed to set the "build image" flag and produced
				garbage surface tiles.  Also, -T[s] produced polygons that were
				not checked for wrapping at a periodic map boundary.

2008-04-25	pwessel
	* x2sys:		Moved *.def to share/x2sys
	* mgd77/mgd77sniffer.c:	Cumulative fixes & updates since August 2007:
				Added -K option to flip navigation flags (if extreme positions
				cause checking to flag good records rather than bad).
				Added -D[x]r option, where x is any preexisting -D option.
				Appending r tells sniffer to use all records in sniffer output
				rather than omitting records flagged with bad navigation.
				Moved speed checking algorithm to precede any other analysis of
				mgd77 data records, including regression checking. This allows
				extreme nav errors to be flagged and ignored in later analysis.
				Modified speed checking algorithm to compare the current nav fix
				to the previous good nav fix, rather than just the previous nav fix.
				This does a better job of flagging the correct fix when excessive
				speeds are found. Previously the current flag was compared to the
				previous flag and whenever excessive speed was computed the current
				record was flagged. This lead to flagging good records at times when
				it was the previous record that was bad.
				Modified manage to accept flags with NaN time stamps.
				Changed speed check from speed > max_speed to fabs (speed) > max_speed
				Bug in E77 output causing distance to be printed when cruises have time stamps
				Track outliers in decimate function, if more than 5% outliers use the
				maximum possible MGD77 values for the 2D bin table in the decimate function.
				Blocked decimation algorithm when dumping values, gradients, etc., and when
				non-regression related warnings are selected (see -W option). Removed bug
				from excessive offset from grid print command.
				Fixed negative array index bug in precision check code
				Fixed an E77 RLS print bug
				Fixed memory deallocation bug - was GMT_free on out[rec] - now on out[curr]
				Added anomaly recalculation toggle to E77
				Use double instead of float for everything but the GMT grids
				Added anomaly sign tracking also fixed e77 scale and icept for A option
				also cleared up kludgy code in grid and ship regression section

2008-04-24	remko
	* ps2raster:		Use PID to augment the file names of temporary files.
				This is not totally secure, but the alternative, mkstemp, is not
				standard enough (not ISO C90).
				Option -N has become obsolete. Use -S and/or -Te instead.

2008-04-22	pwessel
	* psxy.c:		Now will properly clip polygon outline and not draw it along clipped border.
	* configure.ac:		Added support for --enable-mex-mdir=dir and --enable-mex-xdir=dir
				to override the Matlab/Octave preferred paths for local *.mfiles
				and *.mex functions.
	* install_gmt:		Now uses these new variables when running configure.

2008-04-21	pwessel
	* mapproject.c:		-G+ will compute distance between coordinates in first 4 columns

2008-04-19	pwessel
	* configure.ac, src/makegmt.macros.in, mex/makefile:  Added support for --enable-octave
				as an alternative to --enable-matlab

2008-04-16	remko
	* psxy.c, psxyz.c:	Two bug fixes in both programs.
				- If first symbol in list with size was not circle, it got rejected.
				- When sizes of -Sr or -Sj were read from list, they were always inches.

2008-04-15	remko
	* pslib.c, PSL_*.ps:	Renamed a few PostScript commands; reduced prologues in size.
	* gmt_support.c (GMT_just_decode):	Bug fix: was defaulting to BC, instead of BL.
				Also reduced to two arguments (second being default justification).
	* ps{image,legend}.c:	Reduced arguments in GMT_just_decode.
	* ps{scale,text}.c:	---"---
	* gmt_support.h:	---"---
	* gmt_plot.[ch] (GMT_timestamp):	Added "justify" argument to specify justification of
				the time stamp box. Provided by gmtdefaults or -U option.
	* gmt_init.c:		Added justification to GMT_UNIX_POS. Is now <just>/<dx>/<dy>.
				Also added <just> to -U option parsing.
				Fully backwards compatible with previous versions (default just=BL).

	* explain_-U.txt:	---"---
	* common_options.txt:	---"---
	* gmt{,_globals,_common.h}:	---"---

2008-04-14	pwessel
	* psxy[z].c:		Drawing arrows with -SvS and time-coordinates did not work as 2nd time
				coordinate did not get processed properly.

2008-04-13	pwessel
	* grdview.c:		The facade (-N) outline was drawn with contour pen.  Now use -Wf to change
				the facade pen from its default value.
2008-04-11	pwessel
	* x2sys/x2sys_binlist.c:	Could create bad bins because of incorrect reallocation of memory.
	* mex/*.c:		No longer need to include matrix.h separately.  This helps octave compilation.

2008-04-09	remko
	* gmt_init.c (GMT_timestamp):	Added new gmtdefaults value UNIX_TIME_FORMAT, which sets the format for
				the time string in the GMT time stamp (-U option). The default is
				"%Y %b %d %H:%M:%S", which is what was printed up to now, except that
				%e (which is not supported by ISO C90) is replaced by %d.
	* gmtdefaults.txt:	---"---
	* gmt{,_globals.h}:	---"---
	* gmtdefaults_*.orig:	---"---
	* gmt_plot.c:		Use gmtdefs.unix_time_format to format the time stamp. This also requires
				the time stamp box to size with the time string and the additional label
				to move. Tweaked the placement of the strings a bit (better vertical
				placement and relative horizontal placement using spaces).

2008-04-07	remko
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Did not yet properly combine ?varname=suffix on output grid.
	* ps2raster.c:		Security improvements: (1) Replaced tmpnam by mktemp, as tmpnam provides
				a limited number of temp file names. (2) Run commands using system(cmd)
				directly and remove file using remove(file), instead of creating a
				script first.

2008-04-05	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		Fixed final bug in GMT_radial_clip.  Also, GMT_world_map should be
				FALSE for azimuthal projections.  This fixes the -JA -JE pscoast bugs.

2008-04-05	remko
	* gmt_map.c, gmt_proj.c:	Fixed bug in azimuthal equal area projection that had the
				horizon shifted from where it ought to be.
	* *.txt:		Added more short explanations on input and output grid formats.
				In some man pages -F was explained instead of -f.
	* GMT_Chapter_4.tex, GMT_Appendix_B.tex:	Added information on -bic (netCDF tables).

2008-04-04	pwessel
	* gmt_stat.c:		Bug in GMT_median would sometime give subtle mistakes, most noticeable
				when only a few values were passed to the function. Traced to the use
				of size_t variables in expressions that should yield a negative value.

2008-04-04	remko
	* GNUmakefile:		Removed creation of *.tar.gz and GMT_src.zip.
	* configure.ac:		CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS as set by user is ADDED to anything configure
				dreams up. Neither OVERRULES the other.
				NETCDF_LIB and NETCDF_INC can be used to set netCDF locations separately.
				Create versioned shared libraries on Linux.
	* */makefile:		Changes made accordingly.
	* job04c.*:		Renamed from job4c.*
	* run_example_tests.sh:	New test script of example files
	* run_*_tests.sh:	Avoid excessive error messages when compare fails on missing files, etc.
	* ps2raster.c:		Always translate and/or rotate EPS output to origin. Not only when
				in concert with other formats. This makes -P -Te work as -P -Tef.

2008-04-02	remko
	* gmt_grdio.c: 		GMT_is_*_grid now works on header struct. GMT_grd_get_format also strips
				off ?<varname> and stores it in header->varname.
	* gmt_nc.c:		When writing netCDF grid ?<varname> can be used to assign variable name
				and long_name attribute.

2008-04-02	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		The radial clipping would sometimes add arcs using the arc that
				is > 180 degrees.
	* x2sys/x2sys_put.c:	Wrong test when replacing older track info lead to dbase loss.

2008-04-01	pwessel
	* examples/ex19/*:	Next GMT conference is now in 2009.

	* gmt_grdio.c:		Now the grd i/o support the GMT_[DATA|IMG|GRID]DIR environment settings.
	* grdinfo.c:		Reports actual path to the file (may change if GMT_GRIDDIR is involved).

2008-03-25	pwessel
	* pscontour.c:		Must deallocate *ind memory according to which function was used
	* triangulate.c:	Same.  Only affects Windows's insane memory management.

2008-03-24	pwessel
	* gmt_map.c:		Added new rectangular clip function using Sutherland/Hodgman algorithm
				in order to fix incorrect results in grdlandmask.
	* grdblend.c:		Did not pick up node registration before calculating output grid size.

2008-03-24	remko

2008-03-23	pwessel
	* ALL:			More solid 64-bit support after full cleansing with -Wconversion.  All 26
				examples runs clean in both 32-bit and 64-bit mode as do the entire GMT
				documentation.

2008-03-22	remko
	* gmt_nc.c:		Moved GMT_nc_get_att_text to gmt_io.c so it can be used more generally.
	* gmt_io.c:		Implemented GMT_nc_input to support reading netCDF column data (tables).
				This also required changes to GMT_fopen and making GMT_fclose a real routine
				rather than a macro.
	* gmt_io.h, gmt_globals.h:	Changed accordingly.
	* misc/nc2xy.c:		More space for long_name and units.

2008-03-22	pwessel

				integers instead of 4-byte.

2008-03-19	remko
	* gmt_map.c (GMT_map_clip_path):	In polar projection, step size for drawing clip path
				was wrong, resulting in missing wedge in donut shape.

2008-03-15	pwessel
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_get_annot_label did not properly honor the ddd.xx setting
	* pstext.c:		In -D, if /dy is not given it is set equal to dx
	* psxy.c:		Same. Clarified both usage and man pages.

2008-03-13	remko
	* gmt_support.c:	GMT_hsv_to_rgb, GMT_rgb_to_hsv, GMT_check_hsv now uses hsv[]
				instead of h, s, v, in accordance with similar routines.
				GMT_getrgb and GMT_gethsv can read hexadecimal color codes,
				which need to start with #, e.g. #ff0000 for red.

				A + in the gmtdefaults COLOR_MODEL definition overrules interpolation
				mode specified in cpt file.

2008-03-06	pwessel
	* binned_GSHHS*.cdf:	Added two missing barrier islands along Long Island, NY
				to the GSHHS database.  Updated next GSHHS version number to 1.10.

				computation of mean and sum of squares.
	* grdedit.c:		Adjust z_min and z_max when changing add_offset or scale_factor.
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Changed "Latitude", "Longitude" and "Time" to lowercase only.
	* gmt_nc.c:		Use coordinate variables lon(lon), lat(lat) or time(time) when
				appropriate. When updating: need to remove "add_offset" when 0 and
				"scale_factor" when 1.
	* grd2xyz.c:		Do not abort with -R exceeds grid; simply output common region.

2008-03-04	remko
	* grdmath.c, gmtmath.c:	Implemented Welford (1962) algorithm in KURT, SKEW and STD operators

2008-02-27	remko
	* gmt_io.[ch], gmt_calclock.[ch]:	Removed GMT_dt_from_usert, GMT_usert_from_dt, GMT_dtime.
				These were remnants of a time that internal time representation was entirely
				in rata die numbers. Since computations are done extensively with relative
				time (in doubles) keeping the conversion double-to-double became non-sensical.

2008-02-25	pwessel
	* gmt_io.c:		Now skips blank lines that has leading whitespace.  Function
				GMT_is_a_blank_line (char *line) is now used wherever ascii
				input is processed.
	* pscontour.c:		-T option was susceptible to infinite loop if bad record was found.

2008-02-25	remko
	* configure.ac, src/makefile, src/x2sys/makefile, src/mgd77/makefile, makegmt.macros.in:

				to TIME_UNIT and TIME_EPOCH set in .gmtdefaults.
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Fixed 3 bugs in GMT_decode_grd_h_info that caused problems parsing -D
				option. Explicitly exclude = sign from becoming separator.

	* grd2xyz.txt, xyz2grd.txt:	Added information on using TIME COORDINATES.
	* gmt.h, gmt_globals.h:	Time system now fully defined in struct gmtdefs.time_system.
	* gmt_calclock.c:	---"---
	* gmt_init.c, gmt_init.h:	GMT_get_time_system and GMT_init_time_system_structure now use
				time_system as argument so that not only the internal time system
				defined in gmtdefs.time_system can be parsed.
				Need to move these functions to gmt_support.c?
				GMT_get_time_system can now also deal with "TIME_UNIT since TIME_EPOCH".
				'T' no longer required in epoch string.
				That means TIME_SYSTEM = "days since 2000-01-01 12:00" works.
	* gmt_grdio.c:		Now reuses GMT_get_time_system and GMT_init_time_system_structure.

2008-02-24	pwessel
	* gmt_*.c:		Made sure functions call GMT_exit and not exit when quitting.  Only main

	* test/psscale/ages.sh:	Fixed errors in geological names. Put some bars upside down.
	* psscale.c:		Bug fixes: (1) Inverted vertical scale, when using filled rectangles:
				Colours remained in the original order. (2) Inverted vertical or horizontal
				scale, when using rectangles with gradients: Size of rectangles followed
				original order, not inverted. (3) In reverse mode, -Eb was plotting
				foreground triangle, -Ef background triangle.
	* doc/GMT_Appendix_M.tex, doc/scripts/GMT_App_M_2.sh:	Figure added to App M to illustrate uses
				of psscale.

2008-02-20	remko
	* gmt_init.c:		TIME_SYSTEM has become a shortcut for a combination of TIME_EPOCH and
				TIME_UNIT. When used, set gmtdefs.time_unit and gmtdefs.epoch immediately.
				No longer appears in .gmtdefaults4 file.  No more predefined scale,
				rata_die, etc for time systems. Those are determined from
				gmtdefs.time_{unit,epoch} by GMT_init_time_system_structure instead.
				Bug fix: 'c' for seconds was not recognized as TIME_UNIT (expected 's',
				which is kept for backwards compatibility).
	* gmt_time_systems.h:	Removed. Information merged into gmt_init.c.
	* gmt_calclock.h:	GMT_GCAL_EPOCH has become obsolete.
	* gmt_globals.h:	Changed default time_epoch from 2000-01-01 midnight to noon.
				GMT_time_system is no longer an array. time_system removed from gmtdefs.

				unit can be found in GMT_DEFAULTS struct.
	* src/GNUmakefile, gmt_grdio.c, gmt_calclock.c:	Changed accordingly.
	* gmt_defaults.txt:	Updated to reflect changes.
	* .gmtdefaults_test, .gmtdefaults_*.orig, .gmtdefaults4.doc:	Removed TIME_SYSTEM.

2008-02-19	pwessel

2006-11-14
	* segyprogs/segy_io.h:	Now includes inttypes.h only when required
	* pscoast.c:		Now requires a map projection (-JX<width> will give error since the
				data is lon,lat.)
	* gmt_mgg2_header2.[ch]:	NGDC has updated the GRD98 format so that the previously unused variable
				unused1 now will hold cell registation (1 = pixel, 0 = gridline), thus
				extending the GRD98 format to pixel grids as well.
				Fixed a bug in which the grid format type (12) got reset to 0, thus
				making grdinfo report the wrong file format.

				and -Z in header will decode to corresponding pattern.
				New feature: -W- -W+ will turn off outline or reset to default
				while -G- -G+ will turn off fill or reset to default (in -M).

2006-11-08
	* gmt_init.c:		2006-10-03 fix for Windows was botched; format should have been %c not %s

	* make_make.sh:		Now creates grdmath.h and gmtmath.h from grdmath.c and gmtmath.c

2006-11-03
	* gmtmath.c:		Fixed memory allocation bug for files > BUFSIZ records.  Now works correctly
				with multisegment headers.  Multisegment headers now written to the output file
				and not always to stdout.

	* grdcontour.c:		-W[+][c|a] was susceptible to misinterpreting things like -Wcyan as color yan.
	* grdview.c:		-W[c|m] was susceptible to misinterpreting things like -Wcyan as color yan.
	* pstext.c:		-W[<fill>][o|O|c|C][<pen]] is now -W[<fill>,][o|O|c|C][<pen]], i.e., we now use
				a comma to separate the fill and pen (done since fill may be a name containing o|c.
	* psimage.c:		-G<colorname> (e.g., -Gblack) will now be interpreted as foreground color, e.g. -Gfblack

				Fixed time-scaling bug on input (was always seconds).
	* gmt_io.c:		One can now add suffixes 'g' or 'd' to denote geographic coordinates.
	* gmt_init.c:		Made use of geographical and time coordinates more "transparent":
				-R[g|d] forces geographical, so that -JX does not need extra d
				When absolute or relative time is used in -R, -JX does not need extra T or t
				-R[g|d]w/e/s/n[r] also sets geographical.
				Made use of lower and uppercase LlPpDdTtGg consistent.

2006-10-28
	* xyz2grd.c:		Fixed bug in -E header section parsing.

				-F did not use grid registration as default, rather that of input grid
				When using pixel registration, number of cells would be one too large
				-L worked only in very limited case: going from x=[-180;180] to x=[0;360]
				Now supports any periodicity in X and Y (as per manual)

				at all.  Thanks go to Masakazu Higaki for providing the fix.

2006-03-07
	* gmt_io.c:		For years, date in format needs %5d, not %4d since we might have
				a negative year (months and days, however, only need %2d).

2004-11-03
	* pslib.c:		Remko Scharroo, with help from Lloyd Parkes, have greatly
				improved how images are encoded in the PostScript output,

				  ps_imagefill_init and ps_loadraster to PostScript code generated
				  by ps_bitimage.
				- Removed superfluous refreshing of pattern bitmap images,
				  colorization now in /fillimage
				- Added refreshing of pattern bitmap images on changing DPI. Did
				  not work before.

				and function prototypes.  Only gmt_notposix.h
				will be made.

1999-11-08

				install.par can also be designed from the GMT
				web.
	* blockmean.c:		Added -S to get block sums.

				!RECT_GRATICULE on 1998-12-08, i.e. after 3.1.1
				Now fixed (again). All grdimage plots made since
				3.2 came out have problems if they use a map

				M (PLM), the fully normalized surface spherical
				harmonic YLM, and POP (delete top stack element).
	* gmtmath.c:		Added PLM and POP, see above.
	* pstext.c:		Now clips same way as psxy.

1999-01-02
	* grdmath.c:		Added j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn, erf, erfc
				which is present in most math libraries,
				and bei, ber, kei, ker from gmt_math.c
				Also log1p which we already use elsewhere.
	* gmtmath.c:		New program with same operators as grdmath
				except it works on tables instead of grids.
	* gmt_math.c:		Contains definitions of bei, ber, kei, ker.
	* gmt_math_init.csh/bash:	Looks for j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn, erf, erfc
				and puts dummy macros in gmt_math.h if not found.
				(erf and erfc also conditionally included
				in gmt_stat.c if not found locally).

1998-12-29
	* gmt_inic.c:		Now accepts -X -Y where a prepended a indicates
				absolute coordinates [Default is relative,
				prepending r has no effect]
	* pslib.c:		Added absolute mode according to above.
	* gmt_support.c:	Same

1998-12-14
	* gmt_plot.c:		FANCY frame for Lambert Conic had problems
				when south was not multiple of y_inc.

1998-12-09
	* *:			All internal calculations in GMT are now done
				using inches.  All input lengths (e.g., map
				scales or widths, distance gaps, symbols sizes,
				etc) that previously were taken as inches or as
				either inch/cm are now scanned to see if they
				have the unit c, i, m, or p appended (c = cm,
				i = inch, m = meter, p = point).  If no unit is
				appended, GMT will default to the unit set by
				MEASURE_UNIT.  Thus, even if MEASURE_UNIT is cm
				one can specify a 6 inch map with -JM6i.
				All the man pages have also been updated.
	* psmegaplot.c:		Updated to deal with GMT 3.0 PS format.  No
				longer need PS files produced with -K at the end.
	* job??.{csh,bash}:	Now employ unit-independent widths, sizes and
				pens.  Should give identical results regardless
				of which MEASURE_UNIT is in effect.

				the grid but the -R region. 2) images sometimes
				were shifted incorrectly.  Both problems fixed.
	* grdview.c:		Clip path now based on grid, not -R.
				Pixel grids are now processed correctly.

1998-12-02
	* psclip.c:		fclose outside file loop so only ~95 files could
				be opened before we run out of file pointers...
	* gmtselect.c:		Added friendly check to ensure -L and -F gets a
				multisegment file.

1998-12-01
	* gmt_customio.c:	Now reads/writes format # 3 Sun rasterfile header
				correctly on all platforms, like pslib.c
				If you ever used GMT to write Sun rasterfiles
				under Linux, you need to fix the raster headers.

1998-11-30
	* pslib.c:		Added support for Run-Length Encoded rasterfiles.
				PS. this feature has not been extensively tested
				at this point since I haven't gotten many RLE
				files to test on.  Also fixed a bug for 24-bit
				images of odd width.
	* gmthex2ras.c:		Obsolete since Sun rasterfiles are defined at
				the byte level so new read-module in pslib works
				on all platforms.  The GMT patterns will now be
				distributed as binary rasterfiles.

1998-11-29
	* pslib.c:		Read Sun rasters incorrectly on bigendian
				machines.  Now should work ok on all platforms.
	* gmtselect.c:		Now takes -N (and -A, D) to keep/skip points that
				are inside/outside any geographical features
				(coastlines).

				gmt_shore.c as a new function.
	* grdlandmask.c:	Now uses GMT_prep_polygons instead of duplicate
				code from pscoast.  All progs needing to extract
				and use coastline polygons will use this routine.

1998-11-26
	* grd2xyz.c:		Now gives warning if -bo and -Z are selected.
	* xyz2grd.c:		Now gives warning if -bi and -Z are selected.

1998-11-25

				are passed through if both input and output
				modes are ASCII.

1998-11-02
	* grdvolume.c:		Added -Z and -L options; also tighter error
				checking on arguments.
	* grdcontour.c:		Upper left node was not changed by -Z.

1998-10-30
	* psxy[z].c:		Needed to differentiate between number
				of required versus expected columns,
				since binary must read all columns.
	* *.c:			All programs that have -bi option are given
				reasonable default values for the number of
				columns that is expected.  This can always be
				overridden by -bi[s]<n>.

	* blockmode.c:		New program for block mode estimates.
	* blockmedian.c:	Now takes -Q to return (x,y) at median z
				value rather than median x, median y.

1998-10-28
	* GMT:			Now under GNU General Public License.
	* gmt_init.c:		Updating of .gmtdefaults is now using
				advisory file locking.  This means that
				only one GMT program will be able to
				read and write to the .gmtcommands file
				at any time.  In GMT 3.0 and earlier
				versions it happened that a later GMT
				call in a series of pipes would try
				to read while another program was busy
				updating the file.
	* *.c:			Programs now update the .gmtcommands
				file immediately after error checking.
