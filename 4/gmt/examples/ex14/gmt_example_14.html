Example 14.   GMT supports several gridding algorithms.  Perhaps the most used is
the continuous curvature splines in tension algorithm which was used in this
example to grid the data shown in example 12.  Also shown is a comparison of
the gridded surface and a low order polynomial trend surface.  Several GMT
modules were used to make this figure: blockmean and surface prepared the
grid from non-uniformly spaced data, psxy and pstext drew points, lines, and
text, grdcontour did the contouring, grdtrend determined a bicubic trend surface,
and grdtrack sampled both the grid and trend surface along an arbitrary track.
