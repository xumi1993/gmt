To file a bug report for GMT 4, please open a New Issue on the main <A HREF="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu" target="_blank">GMT</A> site
(registration is required to open a <A HREF="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/issues/new" target="_blank">New Issue</A>).
Make sure your report includes the following information:
<UL>
<LI>Version of GMT you are using (e.g., type "psxy -" to see what is reported).
<LI>Hardware platform and Operating System, including version (e.g., under Unix-like systems, type uname -a to get details; for Windows, just tell us what version and if you are running the 32- or 64-bit GMT version).
<LI>Individual GMT program that may have a bug.
<LI>A clear explanation of the problem.
<LI>Example script or command line and, if necessary, test data that
recreate the problem.  If the problem occurs for a huge
data set, try to see if the problem can be reproduced with
a smaller subset.  Do not upload large data files that
exceed a few Mb - we will contact you should we need further
information.
<LI>Other pieces of relevant information.
</UL>
The easier we can reproduce the problem then the quicker we can fix it.  Some bugs are
platform-dependent and can only be reproduced on that system; we have several Linux-flavors
running in a simulator for that purpose.  The subversion archive of GMT will immediately be updated
once a fix has been found.
Note that sometimes a work-around can be crafted while waiting for the next official release.  You may want
to check the <A HREF="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu" target="_blank">GMT Wiki</A> to see if anything relevant have been added.
