The old gmt-help mailinglist was shut down in September 2014 as we now
maintain a discussion forum on the main GMT site.

There remains one electronic mailing list available for users to subscribe to:
<OL>
<LI><B>gmt-group@lists.hawaii.edu</B> is a one-way street
for us to notify users when a new version has been released. No user
can post to this list.  Please subscribe to this list if you ONLY
want email when a new version is available.
</OL>
To add yourself to this mailinglist (maintained by the listserv
program), send email to <A HREF="mailto:listserv@lists.hawaii.edu">listserv@lists.hawaii.edu</A>
with a one-line message. E.g., if your name is John Smith then send

<P><B>subscribe gmt-group John Smith</B>

<P>Listserv automatically obtains your email address.  To unsubscribe, send
<P><B>signoff gmt-group</B>
<P>
instead.</B>.
<P>
To report bugs see the <A HREF="gmt_bugs.html">GMT 4 Bugs</A> page.<P>
<P>
To browse previously posted messages to now-defunct gmt-help list, please visit the official
<A HREF="https://listserv.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=GMT-HELP">GMT 4 Mailing List Archive</A>.
gmt-help is also available as a read-only netnews group via NNTP as
gis.gmtlist at server <A HREF="news://news2.sinica.edu.tw">news2.sinica.edu.tw</A>.

<P>Occasionally, a frustrated new GMT user will convince him/herself
that their work is of paramount importance and hence they feel justified in digging up our
phone numbers and calling us directly to get personal attention to their vexing
problem. Please don't even <B>think</B> about doing this unless you are
prepared to pay our standard consulting fee of USD 300 per hour and endure
insults that would make hardened C-programmers blush...
