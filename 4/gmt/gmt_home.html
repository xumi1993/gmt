The GMT 5 major version was released on November 5, 2013. This site hosts the previous major version, GMT 4.
We strongly recommend that existing GMT 4 users consider visiting the <A HREF="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu" target="_blank">GMT 5 site</A>
and upgrade to GMT 5. You may also consider installing both versions to assist you in the transition from GMT 4 to 5, using gmtswitch to switch between versions.
