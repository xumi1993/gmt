<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Here we will explore what is
involved in creating animations (i.e., movies). Of course, an animation
is nothing more than a series of individual images played back in an
orderly fashion. Here, these images will have been created with GMT.
To ensure a smooth transition from frame to frame we will be following
some general guidelines when writing our scripts. Since there is no
“movie” mode in GMT we must take care of all the book-keeping in our
script. Thus, animations may require a bit of planning and may use more
advanced scripting than the previous static examples. Note: This is a
new chapter introduced with the 4.4.0 version and should be considered
work in progress.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, animation scripts must deal with several specific
phases of movie making:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Define parameters that determine the dimension of the final movie.</li>
<li>Pre-calculate all variables, data tables, grids, or background map
layers that are <em>independent</em> of your time variable.</li>
<li>Have a frame-number loop where each frame is created as a
PostScript plot, then rasterized to a TIFF file of chosen
dimension.</li>
<li>Convert the individual frames to a single movie of suitable format.</li>
<li>Clean up temporary files and eventually the individual frames.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will discuss these phases in more detail before showing our first
example.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>There are several coordinates that you need to consider when planning
your movie. The first is the coordinates of your data, i.e., the
<em>user coordinates</em>. As with all GMT plots you will transform those
to the second set of <em>plot coordinates</em> in inches (or cm) by applying
a suitable region and map projection. As before, you normally do this
with a particular paper size in mind. When printed you get a
high-resolution plot in monochrome or color. However, movies are not
device-independent and you must finally consider the third set of
<em>pixel coordinates</em> which specifies the resolution of the final
movie. We control the frame size by selecting a suitable <em>dpi</em>
setting that will scale your physical dimensions to the desired frame
size in pixels. If you decide up front on a particular resolution
(e.g., 480 by 320 pixels) then you should specify a paper size and
<em>dpi</em> so that their product yields the desired pixel dimensions. For
instance, here it might make sense to plan your plotting on a 4.8 by
3.2 inch “paper” and use 100 <em>dpi</em> to convert it to pixels, but you
are free to use any combination that multiplies to the desired
dimensions. After deciding on frame size you need to consider how
many frames your movie should have. This depends on lots of things
such as how patient you are, how many frames per second you need and
the time range of your animation. We recommend you use variables to
specify the items that go into computing the number of frames so that
you can easily test your script with a few frames before changing
settings and running the full Hollywood production overnight.</li>
<li>Depending on what you want to display, there are usually many
elements that do not change between frames. Examples include a
coastline base map for background, an overlay of text legends,
perhaps some variables that hold information that will be used during
the movie, and possibly subsets of larger data sets. Since
movie-making can take a long time if you are ambitious, it is best to
compute or plot all the elements that can be done outside your main
frame-loop rather than waste time doing the same thing over and over
again. You are then ready for the main loop.</li>
<li>Initialize a frame counter to 0 and have a loop that continues until
your frame counter equals the desired number of frames. You must use
your frame counter to create a unique file name for each frame image
so that the series of images can be lexically arranged. We recommend
using the GMT shell function <strong>gmt_set_framename</strong> to format
the frame counter with an adequate number of leading zeros; see our
examples for details. The bulk of your main loop involves create the
single PostScript plot for this particular frame (time). This can
be trivial or a serious scripting exercise depending on what you want
to show. We will give a few examples with increasing complexity. Once
the PostScript plot is created you need to rasterize it; we
recommend you use <a class="reference internal" href="../psconvert.html"><span class="doc">psconvert</span></a> to
generate a TIFF image at the agreed-upon resolution. We also
recommend that you place all frame images in a sub-directory. You may
increment your frame counter using <strong>gmt_set_framenext</strong>.</li>
<li>Once you have all your frames you are ready to combine them into an
animation. There are two general approaches. (a) If your image
sequence is not too long then you can convert the images into a
single animated GIF file. This file can be included in PowerPoint
presentations or placed on a web page and will play back as a movie
by pausing the specified amount between frames, optionally repeating
the entire sequence one or more times. (b) For more elaborate
projects you will need to convert the frames into a proper movie
format such as Quicktime, AVI, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, etc., etc. There are
both free and commercial tools that can help with this conversion and
they tend to be platform-specific. Most movie tools such as iMovie or
MovieMaker can ingest still images and let you specify the frame
duration. Under OS X we prefer to use Quicktime 7. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> . Another choice is to use the free
<a class="reference external" href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> encoder.  You will find yourself
experimenting with compression settings and movie formats so that the
final movie has the resolution and portability you require.</li>
<li>Finally, when all is done you should delete any temporary files
created. However, since creating the frames may take a lot of time it
is best to not automatically delete the frame sub directory. That way
you can redo the frames-to-movie conversion with different settings
until you are satisfied.</li>
